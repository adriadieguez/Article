Command: C:\Users\diegu\Desktop\Programes\IQTREE\iqtree-2.3.2-Windows\bin\iqtree2.exe -s output_files\IQTTREE_Analysis\0.1 Length1000\4_leaves_1000length_sequences_num1.fasta -m 012345 -z tree_4L_nolengths.txt --redo
Seed:    634402 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Sun May 19 11:53:41 2024
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
